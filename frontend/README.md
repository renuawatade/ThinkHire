# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This folder contains a minimal React frontend scaffold using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Quick start:

1. From this folder run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open the dev server shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:

- The `UploadDropzone` component is a UI placeholder — wire it to your Flask backend endpoint for file uploads.
- Adjust Tailwind colors in `tailwind.config.cjs` to match brand.
